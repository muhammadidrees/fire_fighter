## How To Play :video_game:

The trucks moves left and right automatically. You can control the water hose by pressing the space bar. The heat meter shows the current heat level of the fire. The player has to put out the fire before the heat meter reaches 100%. As the game progresses, the speed of the fire truck increases.
